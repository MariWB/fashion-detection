### Description:
This is an exercise for the `Bootcamp - Microsoft AI for Tech â€“ Creating Intelligent Prompts` by [DIO](https://www.dio.me/).<br>

The [documentation](https://github.com/MariWB/fashion-detection/edit/master/README.md#result) for this project was created with AI based on good prompt engineering practices.

### AI:
Used the `Copilot` with the `Think Deeper` as the motor.

### Prompt for generating documentation:

Using the data from the original [README](https://github.com/lcarli/fashion-detection/blob/dcad49b4f97666ab6ca7f56dec67a43de46e1afb/README.md) as a basis, I created this prompt to ask for the creation of project documentation:

```bash
You are an experienced and organized programmer and need to document your project on GitHub by creating a clear, intuitive, and detailed README using markdown.
Create the project documentation that I will detail below. 
Use all the information to create the README with markdown:

# RESULT:

# Fashion Detection in the Wild (Deep Clothes Detector)

**Deep Clothes Detector** is a clothes detection framework based on **Fast R-CNN**. Given a fashion image, this software identifies and localizes potential upper-body clothes, lower-body clothes, and full-body clothes, respectively.

## Overview

<img src='./misc/demo.gif' width=280>

`Deep Clothes Detector` leverages the robustness of [Fast R-CNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn) to power a fashion-oriented clothes detection system. This framework is specifically designed to detect multiple clothing regions within fashion images, including:
- Upper-body clothes
- Lower-body clothes
- Full-body clothes
